## Python : Create a port scanner

- Type of Challenge: `Verify Coding Knowledge` 
- Duration: `2 days`
- Challenge Type : `Team`

### Prerequisites

1. Identify libraries required.
2. Learn about ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) protocols used for scanning. 
3. Learn about TCP SYN scan for identifying open ports.
4. Creating a range of IP addresses within your local network subnet.
5. Understand ethical considerations and limited testing.
6. Understanding how you can detect port scanning.
7. Understanding how software design reports are written.


### To Do

1. Write the code to create a port scanner in Python.
2. Implement error handling and input validation to ensure the program handles unexpected scenarios gracefully.
2. Test the port scanner on localhost and a remote host to verify its functionality.(Note: Remote host must be within a subnet created with VMs)
3. Write a detailed software designing report.
4. Write a testing report.
5. Write a report on ethical considerations and whether you have complied to the condideration.
6. Write a report on how detection of port scanning can be achieved.

### Bonus

7. Enhance the port scanner with basic security measures, such as rate limiting to prevent excessive scanning.
8. Implement logging functionality to record scan results and any errors encountered.
9. Review the code for potential security vulnerabilities and apply best practices for secure coding.
10. Include the enhancements in the report.
