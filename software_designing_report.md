## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose  
Port Radar's purpose is to scan for opened ports on a targetted device.

### 1.2 Scope  
Port Radar at first will only utilise the basic TCP protocol to check if a port is open for an external TCP connection.
In future updates, we plan to implement an option to scan for ports opened to receive UDP packets and a SYN scan option for a stealthier and faster scan.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations  
#### 1.3.1 Definitions:
<ins>TCP<ins>>: internet protocol used to reliably transfer data using a three-way handshake(SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
<ins>UDP<ins>>: internet protocol that sends out packets without the garentee of arrival or response in contrast with the TCP protocol.
<ins>SYN<ins>>: 
<ins>Port<ins>>:
<ins>Threading<ins>>:

#### 1.3.2 Acronyms:

#### 1.3.3 Abbreviations:

### 1.4 References  
Mention any related documents, specifications, standards, or websites.
